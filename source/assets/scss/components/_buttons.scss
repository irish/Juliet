Buttons should be used responsibly with accessibility in mind. You should use anchor tags when you are linking to an external resource or an internal page link. Use the button tag when you have an application command such as add to shopping cart. Use input tags (such as the submit input type) when creating forms. If you would like to learn more on this subject we highly reccomend reading the following articles.
